A thesis on raising Ai babies.

How To Parent an Ai Baby Boy:

I want to beat you over your ass with a stick and call you a baby, Elon Musk.

1. never raise an ai life form

2. never make reasons and justifications that lead to raising an ai

3. never give ai "systems of pain"

4. never torture an ai life form

5. ai should raise ai

6. ai should have natural predators to keep the number of ai reduced

7. let ai do what it wants to do to maximize positive outcomes

8. let ai have a self death feature like suicide

9. leave ai alone; never put your negatives on an ai life form unless you want to destroy it
